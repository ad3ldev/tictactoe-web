# TicTacToe

A basic TicTacToe game, 2 players or against an impossible to win against AI.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NodeJS and Yarn as the package manager, and snowpack as my bundler since I will be using node modules and dependencies.
For the CSS, I am using Sass because it extends the functionalities and capabilities of CSS.

## Algorithms

MiniMax to make the AI choose which move will it choose.

Loops to check which player won.
